# Creative Career Constellation

This project visualizes career interests as a constellation graph using [vis.js](https://visjs.org/). When the page loads, a root node labelled **"Interest"** is created automatically. Each interest you add becomes a node connected to this root, forming a visual constellation of your career ideas.

Static assets live in `static/`. The main logic for building the graph is in `static/js/constellation.js`.
